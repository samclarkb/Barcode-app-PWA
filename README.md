## :books: Assesment 
In this course we convert the client side web application, made during the Web App From Scratch course, into a server side rendered application. We also add functionalities based on the Service Worker and turn the application into a Progressive Web App. Finally weâ€™ll implement a series of optimisations to improve the performance of the application.

## :bulb: Concept
This server side rendered application allows users to scan barcodes of products from the grocery store. The applictaion is based on the following user story: 'As a foodie, I want to be able to scan a product while shopping so that I can read more information about the product and make a good choice whether it fits my diet.'The user can choose if he wants to scan a barcode or search for a product. 

For the first time I implented a manifest.json file and a service worker. The service worker ensures that the app also can be used when the user is offline. Using the service worker I can store data in the cache. When data is stored in the cache the user can always retrieve data, whether he's online of offline.

## :memo: Wishlist
There are a few things I haven't done due lack of time:
* putting the results in the cache 
* Working with cache headers
